## Description
README Generator is a command-line application designed to create a professional README that displays user input. When a user runs index.js using NodeJS, they are prompted with a series of input questions that account for the README content. When the user answers a question, the answer is displayed in the README in the corresponding section. This application is useful for developers by quickly and easily generating a quality README for any project. 

The following technologies were used to make README Generator function as expected:
* Modules
* Template literals
* Arrow functions
* The spread operator
* The fs package
* The Inquirer package 
* Node JS
